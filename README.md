# n8n-nodes-debughelper

This repo contains a community node with some debug functionality. It is not meant to be used in a production environment (and there probably are very few use cases where you would do so).

### Functions

- Do nothing
- Throw an error
- Generate memory usage (to provoke Out of memory errors)
- Generate random data sets
